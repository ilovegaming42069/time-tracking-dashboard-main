## My process

First, i divided the sections of the HTML given by Sir Bagus, and then i designed the website using CSS so that the design is optimal. However, i find using Jquery and Javascript very hard to do, and it didn't even work.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Jquery

### What I learned

Today i learned that i am still struggling to use Jquery and Javascript. In the future, i have to improve my skills in this area
